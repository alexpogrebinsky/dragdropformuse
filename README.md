# dragdropformuse
A drag and drop html code and javascript for Adobe Muse.
This is a simple code that you can inport into your object in Muse.
The best way to make this work is to put on a master.
What I recommend is modifying it so it can be dragged and dropped along a white screen.  
You can modify the widget according to color, and insert images to represent icons, bars, texts.
